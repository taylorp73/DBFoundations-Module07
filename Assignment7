# Functions
## Introduction
This week, we’ve learned about functions. In the summary below, I will discuss user-defined functions, and explain the differences between scalar, inline, and multi-statement functions. 
## User-Defined Functions
User-defined functions allow users to create custom functions in SQL. They are commands to return a set of values in a database and are tools to return calculations as values (Aggregate Functions, 2022). 
## Scalar, Inline, and Multi-Statement Functions.
Scalar functions pull a single data point in the database (SQL Server Programming…, 2013). Tabular functions can show a table within the database. Both inline and multi-statement functions are tabular. However, an inline function will only use one select statement whereas a multi-statement function will use multiple. All of these are similar as they can be used to retrieve data within a database, however they increase in complexity for the coding, with scalar functions being the most simple, followed by inline, and then multi-statement. 
## Conclusion
To conclude, user-defined functions allow SQL developers to store calculations as values in SQL. These functions include the three types described above.
